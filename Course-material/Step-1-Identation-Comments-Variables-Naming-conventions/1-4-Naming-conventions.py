# Naming conventions

# A variable name must start with a letter or the underscore character
_first_name = "Alex"
name = "Sally"

# A variable name cannot start with a number
# 2name = "Best"

# A variable name can only contain alphanumeric characters and underscores (A-z, 0-9, and _ )
first_name = "Max"
firstname = "Max"
name1 = "Max"
firstName = "Max"

# Variable names are case-sensitive (age, Age and AGE are three different variables)
AGE = 55
age = 55
Age = 55

# Illegal variable names:
# To comment we use Ctrl + /

# my-name = "Olga"
# my name = "Olga"

# Multi Words Variable Names
# There are several techniques you can use to make them more readable:

# Camel Case

myFirstName = "John"

# Pascal Case
# Each word starts with a capital letter:

MyFistName = "John"

# Snake Case
# Each word is separated by an underscore character:

my_first_name = "John"
