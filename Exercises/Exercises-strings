# Exercise 1. String Indexing
# Write a string index that returns just the letter 'r'  from 'Hello World' .
# For example, 'Hello World'[0]  returns 'H' 
# You should only write one line of code for this. Do not assign a variable name to the string.
"Hello World"[8]

# Exercise 2. String Slicing
# Use string slicing to grab the word 'World'  from 'Hello World' 
# For example, print("introduction"[5:9])  returns 'duct' 
# Remember that when slicing you only go up to but not including the end index.
# You should only write one line of code for this. Do not assign a variable name to the string.
print('Hello World'[6:11])
