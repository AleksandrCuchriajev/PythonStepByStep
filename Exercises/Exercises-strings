# Exercise 1. String Indexing
# Write a string index that returns just the letter 'r'  from 'Hello World' .
# For example, 'Hello World'[0]  returns 'H' 
# You should only write one line of code for this. Do not assign a variable name to the string.
"Hello World"[8]

# Exercise 2. String Slicing
# Use string slicing to grab the word 'World'  from 'Hello World' 
# For example, print("introduction"[5:9])  returns 'duct' 
# Remember that when slicing you only go up to but not including the end index.
# You should only write one line of code for this. Do not assign a variable name to the string.
print('Hello World'[6:11])

# Exercise 3. Print Formatting
# Write an expression using any of the string formatting methods we have learned (except f-strings, see note below) to return the phrase 'Python rules!' 
# For example, these phrases both return 'I like apples' :
# 'I like %s' %'apples'
# 'I like {}'.format('apples')
# Your solution should be entered on one line. You can not use variable names, only the strings themselves
print("I'd like when Python {}!".format('rules'))

# Exercise 4. Given the string 'hello' give an index command that returns 'e'. Print out 'e' using indexing
msg = 'hello'
print(msg[1])

# Exercise 5. Reverse the string 'hello' using slicing:
msg ='hello'
print(msg[::-1])

# Exercise 6. Given the string 'hello', give two methods of producing the letter 'o' using indexing. Print out the 'o'
msg ='hello'
# Method 1:
prnt(msg[4])
# Method 2:
prnt(msg[-1])
